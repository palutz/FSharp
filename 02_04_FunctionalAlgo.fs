// Functional Algo and Recursion

// pre-computation is a technique that uses efficient lookup data structures to hold pre-calculated values (cached)
// Carried function format allow programmers to insert computation steps into the "partial application sequence"
// recursion is the technique of having functions call themselves (directly or indirectly),
// in functional language sometimes used in place of loops
